Spam Detection with NLP

This repository contains a notebook and a dataset for a machine learning project focused on detecting spam messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Contents

Spam_Detection_with_NLP.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of loading, processing, and classifying SMS messages into spam or ham using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

SMSSpamCollection: A text file with labeled SMS messages. Each line in the file contains a label ("spam" or "ham") followed by the actual SMS text.

Data

The dataset used in this project (SMSSpamCollection) consists of 5,574 SMS messages, pre-labeled as spam or ham. This dataset is crucial for training our spam detection model.

Notebook Overview

- Installation of Libraries: The notebook begins by installing and importing necessary Python libraries such as NLTK.
- Downloading NLTK Resources: It downloads specific resources like stopwords, which are used for text preprocessing.
- Data Loading and Processing: The notebook demonstrates how to load the text data, preprocess it, and prepare it for modeling.
- Model Training: Instructions and code for training a spam detection model are included.
